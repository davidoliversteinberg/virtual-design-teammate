# Axiom evidence and compliance

Use this workflow whenever an interface will be implemented with Axiom or described as Axiom-compliant. Do not ask the model to memorize the catalog. Retrieve the relevant contract before implementation and prove the result afterward.

## Evidence authority

Use [`component-state-conformance.md`](component-state-conformance.md) to separate product intent, system contract and rendered evidence. There is no single authority for every question.

- The user's task owns the intended outcome and constraints.
- Figma owns intended composition and visual acceptance evidence, but not the validity of an Axiom component, variant or state.
- The installed `@optiaxiom/react` and icon package versions own the executable API and runtime implementation available to the repository.
- The stable official Axiom MCP owns current documented semantics, anatomy, props, patterns, states, tokens, icons, tests and guides.
- Nearby production-quality patterns and approved wrappers own repository-specific conventions when they remain compatible with the installed system.
- Public documentation is supporting evidence and must not be assumed to match the installed version.

Reconcile conflicts according to the question being answered. Never claim that a public example compiles locally until the installed package confirms it, and never copy a Figma state that contradicts the verified component contract without an explicit product decision.

## Mandatory preflight

Before writing UI code:

1. Detect the installed Axiom React and icon versions from the target repository. Identify the package manager and authoritative lockfile.
2. If Figma is supplied, fetch the target node, variables and screenshot. Record component instance names and Code Connect information when available.
3. Complete the semantic component-and-state inventory in `component-state-conformance.md`. Include interactive descendants, states and render modes generated internally by compound components, not only elements visible in the default artifact or changed JSX.
4. Query the stable Axiom MCP for every selected interactive or compound component, even when its name seems familiar:
   - use `search_components` when the mapping is unknown;
   - use `get_component` for the exact API, subcomponents and relevant props;
   - use `get_patterns` for compound composition and components used together;
   - use `get_tokens` before adding or translating styling values;
   - use `search_icons` instead of guessing an export;
   - use `get_guides` or `get_tests` when setup or behavior is material.
5. Reconcile MCP results with installed exports and types. The installed package wins when versions differ.
6. Write a compact internal component evidence record:

| Intent and semantic role | Figma evidence | Axiom component or pattern | Required anatomy/configuration | State model and render modes | Installed verification | Exception |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Do not begin component infrastructure while an evidence row is unresolved.

If the MCP is unavailable, inspect the installed declarations/source and the official documentation links below. State that live retrieval was unavailable. Do not guess.

## Compound component contracts

Treat these as Optimizely implementation rules and verify upstream APIs live before use.

### Card

Do not reconstruct an Axiom Card with arbitrary boxes. Verify the current Card pattern, then use its named anatomy. The current stable pattern includes:

- `CardHeader` as the required identifying region;
- optional `CardPreview`, `CardImage` and `CardFooter` regions;
- `CardLink` for the card's primary link;
- `CardAction` and `CardCheckbox` for contextual actions and selection;
- `CardPreview` overlay slots `addonTopLeft`, `addonTopRight`, `addonBottomLeft` and `addonBottomRight`;
- `CardHeader` slots `addonBefore` and `addonAfter`, plus its description.

Put controls in the documented slots rather than absolutely positioning parallel markup. Use a product-specific wrapper such as an asset card only when the same domain composition repeats and the wrapper preserves the Axiom anatomy.

Inspect the installed Card and CardPreview styles before overriding their padding, margin or overflow. Some versions use parent padding together with negative preview margins and a separately padded overlay. Setting a zero-padding Card or clipping overflow can cancel a slot's visible inset even while the overlay itself reports the expected padding. Follow `acceptance-and-geometry.md`: measure every occupied corner against the visible preview boundary and verify default, hover and narrow states.

### Button and icons

Use the Axiom `Button` `icon` and `iconPosition` API. Do not manually assemble icon, label and spacing inside a button.

Apply the Optimizely product convention unless the supplied Figma component or a verified product rule says otherwise:

- a leading/start Material icon uses its filled treatment;
- a trailing/end Material icon uses its unfilled treatment;
- an icon-only button has an accessible name and a tooltip when its meaning is not obvious;
- menu, ellipsis, disclosure, select and segmented triggers use their purpose-built Axiom components instead of a generic Button recreation.

Verify that the chosen icon export and filled variant exist. A visually similar invented name is not an acceptable fallback.

## Figma-to-code reconciliation

For every Figma component instance:

1. Use Code Connect when it maps the instance to an Axiom component.
2. Otherwise search Axiom by the component's role and verify a documented pattern.
3. If no single component exists, compose documented Axiom primitives and record the composition.
4. If neither a component nor a supported composition exists, mark a design-system gap. Do not silently invent a shared primitive.

Then reconcile the Figma variant and visible state with the current component's documented state model. Preserve the product intent, not an unsupported or stale representation. When they disagree, classify the conflict as a prototype defect, version mismatch, intentional product exception or design-system gap before implementation.

A gap may justify a local implementation only when the user requested it or the target repository already owns that pattern. A new shared wrapper needs a demonstrated gap and repeated credible use. Keep an isolated prototype clearly labeled when those conditions are not met.

## Mandatory postflight

After implementation and before visual scoring:

1. Inventory every changed Axiom component, compound part, icon and token.
2. Re-run `get_component` for each changed compound or interactive component and compare the implementation with its current parts, props and documented pattern.
3. Reinspect parent/child layout defaults whenever padding, margin, overflow, position, display or sizing was overridden.
4. Confirm every imported component and icon exists in the installed packages.
5. Run TypeScript, lint and the repository's deterministic Axiom checker when one exists. Treat unsupported props, legacy component parts, invalid compound anatomy, raw replacement controls and icon-policy failures as blockers.
6. Reconcile the rendered accessibility tree or focusable DOM with the component-and-state inventory so internally rendered controls are not omitted.
7. Exercise every applicable transition and distinct render mode, then complete `component-state-conformance.md`, `acceptance-and-geometry.md` and `visual-quality-gates.md`.
8. Diagnose and repair the owning layer for every mismatch. An upstream claim requires isolated evidence against the installed version and does not permit a completion claim while the required behavior remains broken.
9. Report the component evidence record, checks run, exceptions, version differences and anything that could not be verified.

Code compilation does not prove correct composition. Visual similarity does not prove valid API use. Both evidence paths must pass.
